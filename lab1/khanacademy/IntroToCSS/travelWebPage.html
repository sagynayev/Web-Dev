        <p>This year, I went to <span class='cities'>Kyrgyzstan</span>. It is a beautiful country! My first stop was <span class='cities'>Bishkek</span>. I saw the big mosque called Ala-Too Mosque. It is very pretty!<br>

<br>
Also, I visited <span class='cities'>Issyk-Kul Lake</span>. The lake is very big and the water is clear. I enjoyed swimming and relaxing on the beach. I finished my trip in <span class='cities'>Osh</span>, where I saw the famous Suleiman Mountain. The view from the top was amazing!
<br>
<br>
<strong class='cities'>Kyrgyzstan</strong> is a country that is very <em>exciting</em> to explore!
